        { q: "Which problem is annuities MOST directly designed to solve?", options: ["Maximizing market returns", "Retirement income risks (longevity and sequence risk)", "Avoiding all taxes", "Beating inflation every year"], correct: 1, explanation: "Annuities are primarily risk-transfer tools for retirement income risks, especially longevity risk (outliving money) and sequence of returns risk (bad returns early while withdrawing)." },
        { q: "What is longevity risk?", options: ["Needing money for long-term care", "Living longer than your money lasts", "Inflation eroding purchasing power", "Interest rates rising"], correct: 1, explanation: "Longevity risk is the risk of outliving your assets." },
        { q: "Sequence of returns risk matters MOST when you are:", options: ["In your 20s accumulating", "Still working but saving less", "Withdrawing from a portfolio to fund spending", "Buying a house"], correct: 2, explanation: "Withdrawals make return timing critical. Early losses plus withdrawals can permanently impair recovery." },
        { q: "In the relationship Next balance = (Balance - Withdrawal) × (1 + return), what happens if a large loss occurs early?", options: ["It usually has no lasting effect", "It can permanently reduce the base that future gains compound on", "It increases future compounding", "It guarantees higher future returns"], correct: 1, explanation: "A loss shrinks the post-withdrawal base; later gains then compound from a smaller number." },
        { q: "Why is planning to average life expectancy risky for retirees?", options: ["Because it is too conservative", "Because it ignores tail outcomes where people live much longer", "Because it assumes markets always rise", "Because it eliminates inflation risk"], correct: 1, explanation: "Retirement failure is usually driven by tail outcomes: living materially longer than average and/or facing adverse early-market sequences." },
        { q: "What is the best description of the '4% rule'?", options: ["A guaranteed withdrawal rate for life", "A historical rule of thumb for starting withdrawals over a fixed horizon", "A regulatory requirement for retirees", "A promise from the government"], correct: 1, explanation: "The 4% rule is a historically-derived heuristic with assumptions (horizon, asset mix, market regime). It is not a guarantee." },
        { q: "What makes lifetime annuity payouts possible at a higher spending rate than a self-managed drawdown (all else equal)?", options: ["Insurers always earn higher investment returns", "Mortality pooling / mortality credits", "Guaranteed stock market gains", "No fees exist in annuities"], correct: 1, explanation: "Pooling allows the group to spend more safely because not everyone lives to extreme ages; this creates mortality credits." },
        { q: "Which is a core trade-off when buying annuity guarantees?", options: ["You always lose principal immediately", "You usually give up some liquidity/flexibility/upside for reduced risk", "You get unlimited upside with zero constraints", "You eliminate all compliance requirements"], correct: 1, explanation: "Guarantees have a price: less liquidity, less flexibility, and/or capped upside depending on product type and riders." },
        { q: "Which statement is compliance-safe?", options: ["State guaranty associations make annuities as safe as FDIC insurance", "Guaranty association coverage varies by state and is limited; it is not a selling point", "Guaranty coverage is unlimited for annuities", "Guaranty coverage replaces due diligence"], correct: 1, explanation: "Guaranty associations are state-law limited backstops. Coverage varies and should not be framed as FDIC-equivalent or used as a sales hook." },
        { q: "What does the 'floor vs upside' framing mean in retirement income planning?", options: ["Invest everything in bonds for safety", "First secure essential spending with reliable income, then invest remaining assets for growth/discretionary goals", "Always annuitize 100% of assets", "Avoid guaranteed income to maximize growth"], correct: 1, explanation: "A common framework is to cover essentials with reliable income ('floor'), then use investments for discretionary spending and growth ('upside')." }

      2: [
        { q: "Which two axes are used in this module to classify annuities?", options: ["Fees and commissions", "Timing and market exposure", "Liquidity and inflation", "Tax bracket and age"], correct: 1, explanation: "Module 2 classifies annuities by when income starts (timing) and who bears market risk (market exposure)." },
        { q: "A client says: 'I want a paycheck now from a lump sum.' Which archetype fits the pattern?", options: ["DIA", "MYGA", "SPIA", "FIA"], correct: 2, explanation: "SPIAs are the cleanest immediate-income archetype: lump sum in, income now/soon." },
        { q: "A client says: 'I want to hedge living past 90; income can start later.' Which archetype is the cleanest match?", options: ["SPIA", "DIA", "VA", "MYGA"], correct: 1, explanation: "DIAs are often described as longevity insurance: income starts later to hedge extreme longevity." },
        { q: "Which statement about indexed annuities is MOST accurate?", options: ["They deliver the same return as the index", "They credit interest via a formula tied to an index and often include caps/spreads/participation", "They are the same as variable annuities", "They always lose money when the index is down"], correct: 1, explanation: "‘Indexed’ typically means formula-based crediting linked to an index, not direct index ownership." },
        { q: "Which product category is typically a security (not just state insurance-regulated)?", options: ["FIA", "MYGA", "RILA", "Traditional fixed deferred annuity"], correct: 2, explanation: "RILAs are registered products (securities). Variable annuities are also securities." },
        { q: "Which product category most directly exposes the contract value to full market risk?", options: ["Fixed", "Indexed (FIA)", "Buffered (RILA)", "Variable (VA)"], correct: 3, explanation: "VAs generally expose the account value to market risk via subaccounts." },
        { q: "What is the most common 'structural trade-off' that comes with many deferred annuities?", options: ["Unlimited liquidity with no conditions", "Surrender charges limiting access for a period", "Guaranteed stock market returns", "No disclosures required"], correct: 1, explanation: "Many deferred annuities use surrender schedules to price guarantees and commissions." },
        { q: "A client wants principal protection in the contract value but is OK with limited upside. Which category is the best fit?", options: ["VA", "FIA", "RILA", "Equities in a brokerage account"], correct: 1, explanation: "FIAs commonly pair a floor with capped/limited upside via crediting terms." },
        { q: "A client can accept some losses in exchange for more upside than an FIA. Which category best matches the mental model?", options: ["MYGA", "Fixed deferred", "RILA", "SPIA"], correct: 2, explanation: "RILAs are often positioned as defined-risk/buffered exposure with real downside beyond the buffer/floor." },
        { q: "Which is the cleanest mental model for MYGAs and traditional fixed deferred annuities?", options: ["Pension replacement", "Bond/CD-like contract with a surrender schedule", "Full equity exposure wrapper", "Index replication engine"], correct: 1, explanation: "Fixed and MYGA products are often understood as principal-protected, rate-based contracts with liquidity constraints." }
      ],
      3: [
        { q: "What is the cleanest mental model for a SPIA?", options: ["Stock-market replacement", "Pension replacement (buy a paycheck)", "Tax shelter for trading", "Bank account with a teaser rate"], correct: 1, explanation: "A SPIA is best understood as pension replacement: a lump sum converted into a predictable lifetime income stream." },
        { q: "Why can a SPIA pay income for life without the buyer knowing their date of death?", options: ["Because insurers can predict individual lifespans exactly", "Because insurers pool many annuitants and price based on mortality assumptions", "Because SPIAs always earn higher market returns", "Because SPIAs have no costs"], correct: 1, explanation: "Insurers pool longevity risk across many contracts (mortality pooling) and price using mortality assumptions plus interest rates and expenses." },
        { q: "Which payout option generally produces the highest income?", options: ["Life-only", "Cash refund", "Life + 20-year certain", "Joint & survivor (100%)"], correct: 0, explanation: "Life-only typically pays the most because it provides the least beneficiary/survivor protection." },
        { q: "How does adding a period-certain or cash-refund feature typically affect income?", options: ["Raises income because risk is lower", "Reduces income because more payments are guaranteed to beneficiaries", "Has no effect on pricing", "Guarantees market-like returns"], correct: 1, explanation: "Adding guarantees for beneficiaries reduces the insurer’s ability to rely on longevity pooling, so income typically falls." },
        { q: "Which risk is usually the biggest long-run weakness of a level-payment SPIA?", options: ["Inflation erosion of purchasing power", "Short-term interest-rate volatility", "Index caps", "Brokerage margin calls"], correct: 0, explanation: "A fixed nominal payment can lose substantial real purchasing power over a long retirement." },
        { q: "Which approach is a common way to mitigate inflation risk while using a SPIA?", options: ["Put 100% into a life-only SPIA and ignore inflation", "Partial annuitization: SPIA for essentials, portfolio for growth", "Borrow against the SPIA for spending", "Switch to a VA after annuitizing"], correct: 1, explanation: "A common strategy is to build an income floor with a SPIA and keep other assets invested for inflation-sensitive spending." },
        { q: "High-level tax treatment: a SPIA funded with qualified (pre-tax) money is generally:", options: ["Mostly tax-free return of principal", "Taxed as ordinary income when paid out", "Taxed as long-term capital gains", "Never taxable"], correct: 1, explanation: "Qualified distributions are generally taxable as ordinary income (subject to specific rules and exceptions)." },
        { q: "In non-qualified SPIAs, what does the exclusion ratio concept describe?", options: ["How the insurer sets payout rates", "How each payment is split between taxable earnings and tax-free return of basis (during the expected return period)", "How surrender charges are computed", "How state guaranty limits are calculated"], correct: 1, explanation: "The exclusion ratio is used to determine the taxable vs non-taxable portion of each payment for certain non-qualified annuity payouts." },
        { q: "Which statement is most accurate and compliance-safe?", options: ["SPIAs are always the best option for retirees", "SPIAs trade liquidity and legacy flexibility for longevity insurance and simplicity", "SPIAs guarantee you'll beat inflation", "SPIAs are FDIC-insured"], correct: 1, explanation: "SPIAs are a trade. They can be a strong fit for income needs, but not universally. They are not FDIC-insured." },
        { q: "Which client pattern is MOST likely a poor fit for a SPIA?", options: ["Client needs a predictable income floor", "Client has high emergency liquidity needs and uncertain expenses", "Client has strong longevity concerns", "Client prefers simplicity over managing a portfolio"], correct: 1, explanation: "SPIAs are often difficult to unwind; high liquidity needs and uncertain spending needs are common reasons to avoid or limit annuitization." }

      6: [
        { q: "What portion of FIA premiums typically goes into bonds vs options?", options: ["50% bonds, 50% options", "70% bonds, 30% options", "95-97% bonds, 3-5% options", "100% options"], correct: 2, explanation: "FIAs invest 95-97% in bonds (to guarantee principal) and only 3-5% in index options (to provide upside). This 'option budget' determines your cap/participation." },
        { q: "Over the past 20 years, typical FIAs have captured approximately what percentage of S&P 500 returns?", options: ["10-20%", "40-60%", "80-90%", "100%+"], correct: 1, explanation: "FIAs have historically captured 40-60% of S&P 500 returns. This is the trade-off for having the 0% floor protection." }
